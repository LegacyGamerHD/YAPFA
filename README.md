# YAPFA test
## (Yet another ~~Paper~~ Tuinity fork attempt)
[![Github-CI](https://github.com/tr7zw/YAPFA/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tr7zw/YAPFA/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![CodeMC-CI](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Tr7zw/job/YAPFA/badge/icon?style=plastic)](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Tr7zw/job/YAPFA/)

## What ##

This Fork tries to import universal patches from [EMC](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft) and [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur), while adding a few more "extrem" patches that modify the basic minecraft server for more performance. This fork was based on Paper, but is now based on [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity).

## Building and setting up
Run the following commands in the root directory:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
./yapfa up
./yapfa patch
```

## LICENSE

## OS Support / Scripts
We only directly support Ubuntu 14.04 for the shell scripts. It may work elsewhere... but no promises. (This fork is developed under Windows with MINGW/WLS, and so far I don't intend to modify the scripts to any mojor point)

### scripts/importmcdev ###
Imports specific files from mc-dev that CB/Spigot doesn't use but we need.

### scripts/updatespigot ###
updates the Bukkit/CraftBukkit/Spigot baseline when passed --update, otherwise regenerates the baseline with changes
to mcdev from importmcdev

Run `scripts/applypatches` then `scripts/rebuildpatches` immediately after

### scripts/generatesources ###
Generates an mc-dev folder that can be added to IDE for the other mc-dev files located in minecraft-server.jar

### scripts/rebuildpatches ###
Rebuilds patch state from the YAPFA-* repo's current state. Automatically handles patch deletion and renaming
for you unlike Spigots version of these scripts.

### scripts/applypatches ###
Takes current patches/{bukkit,craftbukkit} and applys them on latest spigot upstream
